# Receipt printer for Hack Club Grants

This project outputs and prints a receipt on a real receipt printer each time a Sprig or OnBoard grant from Hack Club is issued.

## Dependencies

    $ npm install -g @tracespace/cli@next

## To-Do

- Get the code up and running on a Raspberry Pi manually
- Add some sort of remote monitoring / access system to the Raspberry Pi
- Write an onboarding guide that makes it easy to get the script up and running on a new Raspberry Pi
- Dream: Separate system into a client-server model, have the receipts generated serverside, then pushed to the clients attached to printers.

# Setup

Set up Raspberry Pi using gadget mode
